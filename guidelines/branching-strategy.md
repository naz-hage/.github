Branching strategy in developing applications should include the following:

**Main Branch:**  Stable codebase, reflecting the production-ready state.

**Development Branch:** Integration branch for features, fixes, and enhancements. This is where active development occurs, and once stable (pass peer code review and unit tests, changes are merged back into the main branch.  Must be deleted after merge.  In GitHub, you can add a rule to automatically delete the branch after merge.

**Feature Branches:** Created from the development branch for each new feature or significant change. These are merged back into the development branch upon completion after code review and testing.  This should be short lived typically no longer than a Sprint or two.  If there is a large feature, the branch should be merge to Main via a feature branch that will be turned only when code and test is complete.  This branch should be rebased on a regular basis. Must be deleted after merge.

**Release Branches:** These are used to prepare for a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i's and crossing of t's without interrupting the ongoing work on the development branch.  A strategy will be determined how long these branches stay.

**Hotfix Branches:** Created from the main branch to quickly address critical bugs in production. After the fix, these branches are merged back into both the main and development branches to ensure consistency.

The key principle is to isolate development efforts, feature-based work, and maintaining a stable mainline.
